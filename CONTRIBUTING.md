# Getting Involved

Code patches are absolutely welcome. However, they're not the only way to get involved: you can help the project by [reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs); improving docs; helping others on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/metreeca/link/issues); tweeting to [@metreeca](https://twitter.com/metreeca); telling the world about Metreeca ;-)

# Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug on the project's [issues](https://github.com/metreeca/link/issues) page, search already reported issues for similar cases and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.

If you've really found a new bug, creating a helpful report that will make fixing it much easier and quicker:

- Write a descriptive, specific title. Bad: *Shape doesn't work*.  Good: *Unable to define cardinality in shape*.
- Include Metreeca/Link, OS and Java VM version info.
- Describe how to reproduce the bug. Try to weed out immaterial details to help us home in on the real problem as quickly as possible.
- Describe the behaviour you'd expect from the framework.
- Describe the behaviour you are actually observing.
- Share any workaround you have worked out.

If you just want some help with the framework or your project, try asking a specific how-to question or opening a more general discussion on the [community forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/metreeca).

# Suggesting Features

If you think you have a good idea about improving or extending Metreeca/Link, feel free to open a ticket on the project's [issues](https://github.com/metreeca/link/issues) page, ignoring the issue reporting template.

Again search already reported suggestions and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.
